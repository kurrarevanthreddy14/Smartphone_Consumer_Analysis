## 🎯 Objective

To analyze and visualize:

- How smartphone features like **camera**, **battery life**, and **screen size** influence consumer buying decisions
- How **pricing trends** evolve over time based on consumer preferences
- The effect of **brand reputation** and **market shifts** on purchase patterns
